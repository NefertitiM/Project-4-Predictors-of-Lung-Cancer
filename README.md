Exploring Early Detection Methods for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Machine Learning Models

Together small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the second most common cancer in the United States. About 10% to 15% of all lung cancers are SCLC, and about 80% to 85% are NSCLC. Lung cancer is also the leading cause of all cancer deaths in the United States, in part due to its late diagnosis. On average, people diagnosed with lung cancer are 70 with a small amount of people being diagnosed under the age of 45.
