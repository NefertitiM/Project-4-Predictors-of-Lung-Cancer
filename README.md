# Exploring Early Detection Methods for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Machine Learning Models

**Authors:** Nefertiti Muhammad, Adrian De La Cruz, Joe Coffaro, Alexander Walden

## Overview

Together, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are the second most common cancers in the United States. Approximately 10% to 15% of all lung cancers are SCLC, while NSCLC accounts for about 80% to 85%. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., often diagnosed at later stages, which complicates treatment and negatively impacts survival rates. Research into early detection methods is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

In this project, we developed neural network and regression models to predict survival outcomes for NSCLC patients. Our goal is to utilize machine learning to identify factors that can aid in early detection.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from the paper "Distinct patterns of somatic genome alterations in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas" (Nat Genet. 2016 Jun;48(6):607-16. doi: 10.1038/ng.3564). It was downloaded from cBioPortal:

[NSCLC TCGA Broad 2016 Dataset](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016)

This dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and genomic data, allowing us to analyze differences among patients and build predictive models.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   - Handling missing values and normalizing data.

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementing neural network models for predictive analysis.
   - Utilizing regression techniques to evaluate survival outcomes.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
