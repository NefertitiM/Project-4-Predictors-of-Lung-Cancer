# Exploring Early Detection Methods for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Machine Learning Models

Together small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the second most common cancer in the United States. About 10% to 15% of all lung cancers are SCLC, and about 80% to 85% are NSCLC. Lung cancer is also the leading cause of all cancer deaths in the United States, in part due to its late diagnosis. On average, people diagnosed with lung cancer are 70 with a small amount of people being diagnosed under the age of 45. Lung cancer is espicially difficult to treat in its later stages, so research into early detection methods are key to increasing survival rates of patients diagnosed with it. In this project, neural network and regression modeling was developed to predict cancer survival in NSCLC. Our dataset came from the Nature Genetics 201 paper, Distinct patterns of somatic genome alterations in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. (Nat Genet. 2016 Jun;48(6):607-16. doi: 10.1038/ng.3564) and was downloaded from the cBioPortal, https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016.
